Title: JavaFX Calculator - A Simple Yet Powerful Calculator for Your Daily Needs

Project Description:

This JavaFX project presents a simple yet powerful calculator that can perform basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. It features a user-friendly interface with a text field to display the result and buttons for digits and operations.

Key Features:

1. User-Friendly Interface:
   - Clean and intuitive design with a clear layout of buttons and text field.
   - Easy-to-read display shows the result of calculations in real-time.

2. Basic Mathematical Operations:
   - Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Handles both positive and negative numbers.

3. Error Handling:
   - Detects and handles division by zero errors, displaying an appropriate message.
   - Prevents invalid input, such as entering two consecutive operators without a number.

4. Parenthesis Support:
   - Includes support for parentheses, allowing users to create more complex expressions.

5. Conversion between Infix and Postfix Notation:
   - Converts infix expressions entered by the user into postfix notation for efficient evaluation.

Implementation Details:

- JavaFX: The project utilizes the JavaFX library to create the graphical user interface (GUI) and handle user interactions.

- Stack Data Structure: A stack is employed to evaluate postfix expressions efficiently and handle parenthesis.

- Exception Handling: The program incorporates exception handling to catch and display error messages for division by zero and invalid input.

How to Use:

1. Open the application.
2. Enter a mathematical expression in the text field using digits and operators (+, -, x, /).
3. Click the "=" button to evaluate the expression and display the result.
4. Use the "C" button to clear the text field and start a new calculation.

This calculator is a useful tool for students, professionals, and anyone who needs to perform basic mathematical operations quickly and easily. 
It demonstrates the power of JavaFX for creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces.
